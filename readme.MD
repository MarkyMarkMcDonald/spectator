### Heyooooo! ###

##### Dependencies #####
This project uses the [meteor](http://www.meteor.com/) framework.

You'll need to install it (curl https://install.meteor.com | sh) before starting a local server with "meteor run"

## Goal ##
It's hard for newer MTG players to follow along a stream or video of a game.
I aim to create a platform that gives spectators an easy way to follow along with the game, and on-site officials an intuitive
and efficient way to record the board state.
